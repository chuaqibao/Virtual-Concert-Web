## Description

Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, our concert is being hosted online on this video-streaming platform. 

Each user is allowed to login using their authenticated email once at a time to prevent multiple users from sharing the same "concert ticket". Users will not be allowed to log into the same account to watch the concert across multiple devices/browsers.

Upon logging in, the account will expire after 3 hours, as a one-time off "concert ticket".
